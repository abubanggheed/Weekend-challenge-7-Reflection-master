#React-Redux-Router Multipage Form
This project is a challenge to build a form across multiple pages in a react app by using a redux store. Practically, there is no reason why the question in this form should not be on the same page. That said, this is a proof of concept that a multipage form can be done efficiently on React with redux.

###Set-Up
This is a node project. To start off, get dependancies with
```
npm install

There are two custom scripts that run the program:
```
npm run server
```
and
```
npm run client.
```

###Features
- A quick feedback survey.
- A database that stores feedback results.

###Admin View
The admin view can be reached by going to /admin (don't tell anyone!).
Results may be flagged or deleted.
